# fly Lovely_Bird

A game cloned or inspired by the popular "Flappy Bird," with some minor changes.

How to Play

Starting the Game

1. Launch the "Lovely_Bird" app on your device.


2. The game begins automatically upon launch.

**
Bird Control

The bird moves forward on its own.

Tap anywhere on the screen to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.

Each tap triggers a small upward motion.
---

Navigating Through Pipes

Watch for gaps between pairs of green pipes.

Skillfully guide the bird through these gaps without colliding with the pipes or the ground.
---

Mastering Timing

The bird is affected by gravity and falls when not flapping.

Timing is essential:

Tap too early, and the bird might hit the top of a pipe.

Tap too late, and it might crash into the bottom.

Scoring

Gain 1 point for each pair of pipes successfully cleared.

Pipe positions and patterns vary as you progress, adding to the challenge.

Challenge and Perseverance

Frequent crashes are part of learning.

Strive to beat your highest score by improving your timing and focus.
