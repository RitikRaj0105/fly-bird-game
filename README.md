Fly Lovely_Bird
A game inspired by the popular Flappy Bird, with some exciting tweaks and changes!

How to Play
Starting the Game

Open the Lovely_Bird app on your device.
The game starts immediately once launched.
Bird Control

The bird flies forward on its own.
Tap anywhere on the screen to make the bird flap its wings and rise. Each tap results in a slight upward motion.
Navigating Through Pipes

Watch for gaps between pairs of green pipes.
Skillfully guide the bird through these gaps without hitting the pipes or the ground.
Mastering Timing

Gravity affects the bird—if you don’t flap, it will fall.
Timing is crucial: Tap too early, and the bird might collide with the top of a pipe. Tap too late, and it may crash into the bottom.
Scoring

Earn 1 point each time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
As you progress, the pipe positions and patterns change, making it more challenging.
Challenge and Perseverance

The game is tough, but that's the fun part! Crashes happen often, but they’re part of the learning process.
Push yourself to beat your highest score by improving your timing and focus.
Game Over

The game ends if the bird crashes into a pipe or hits the ground.
Your final score will be shown on the screen.
Tap "Play Again" to restart and try for a higher score.
Enjoyment

Enjoy mastering the game’s challenges, with retro-style graphics and simple but addictive mechanics.
Celebrate each small victory as you improve and go further with each attempt.
Keep flapping, soaring, and pushing your limits with Fly Lovely_Bird—the more you play, the better you get!
Remember, frustration is part of the fun. With practice and perseverance, you’ll conquer those tricky gaps!
